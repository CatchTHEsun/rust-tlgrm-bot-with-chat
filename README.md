# rust-tlgrm-bot-with-chat

This bot uses the OpenAI API to generate a response to any message it receives from a user. It sends the message to the API, and then sends the generated text back to the user. You can customize the parameters of the API request to control the length and style of the generated text. Note that you will need to include the openai crate in your Cargo.toml file to use the OpenAI API.

Use your project Cargo.toml.
